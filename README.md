# SDG Global Progress Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the progress of three United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):  
- SDG 1: No Poverty  
- SDG 4: Quality Education  
- SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy  

The project leverages global datasets to understand trends and generate actionable insights related to poverty, education, and clean energy access. SQL Server was used for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI dashboards were created to visualize the findings.

---

## Objectives
- Clean and transform global datasets using SQL Server  
- Create interactive dashboards to visualize trends for each SDG  
- Generate actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders  
- Document the methodology and results in a structured report

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** – for data cleaning, ETL, and transformations  
- **Power BI** – for dashboard creation and visualization  
- **Python** (optional) – for preprocessing and analysis  
- **Microsoft Excel** – for dataset handling and minor calculations

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** United Nations open data and other publicly available datasets  
- **Files included:** All cleaned datasets are stored in the `data/` folder  
- **Note:** Original datasets can be linked if they are too large to upload

## Methodology
1. Collected datasets from UN and other global sources  
2. Cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed data using SQL Server  
3. Designed dashboards in Power BI to visualize key trends and metrics  
4. Generated insights and summarized findings in `report.pdf`

---

## Key Insights
- Countries with higher education enrollment rates generally show lower poverty levels  
- Access to affordable and clean energy has increased in most developing countries over the last decade  
- Some regions still face major challenges in achieving SDG targets, especially in rural areas  
- Data visualizations reveal patterns that can inform policy decisions and resource allocation
